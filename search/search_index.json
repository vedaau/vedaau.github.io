The Trash Height Subsystem uses an internal IR sensor to monitor the fill level of the trash can. When the trash reaches a certain height, the subsystem sends a signal to the External IR Sensor and UI Lights subsystem. This triggers a red LED to notify the user that the trash is full and needs to be emptied, ensuring safe and convenient operation while helping maintain a clean environment.</p> <p>For full details of the team project, please visit the team report.</p>","tags":["datasheet","egr304"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My part in the Autocan project was to design the Trash Height Subsystem.

Fast response time. Compact size, making it easy to integrate into various devices. Low power consumption. Inexpensive Performance can be affected by ambient light conditions. Limited range compared to some other ToF sensors. Requires careful calibration for optimal accuracy. May struggle with reflective surfaces or dark materials. .  Option 2 OPB732 IR Sensor $4/each Link to Product Known component and setup Not too expensive Compact High availability Limited range  No modern features Interference sensitivity  Option 3 Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F IR analog distance sensor $7.25/each Link To Product Easy to interface with microcontrollers. Fast update rate for quick detection. Compact size Decent Range Anything closer than 10 cm won\u2019t be reliably measured. High Power consumption. Output signal is noisy and non-linear. Lower accuracy at extremes / sensitivity to reflectance. <p>Choice: OPB732 IR Sensor Rationale: The OPB732 IR sensor is a simple and reliable option that\u2019s easy to set up with the Curiosity Nano board. It doesn\u2019t need extra parts to work and gives consistent distance readings for our project. It\u2019s small, affordable, and well-known, which makes testing and integration quick and straightforward..</p> <p>Voltage Regulator </p> Solution Pros Cons  Option 1 LM7805 $1/each Link to Product Simplicity, very easy to use Low noise output Easily available  Cheap Requires external capacitors Not Adjustable  Option 2 AMS1117-5.0 $0.5/each Link to Product Low Dropout Voltage Widely Available Compact package Built-in Protections Thermal Issues Fixed Output Sensitive to Capacitor Choice  Option 3 LM2596 $2/each Link to Product Adjustable Output Wide Input Voltage Range. Integrated protection features. Stable Output Complex design Generates electrical noise Larger Circuit Footprint <p>Choice: LM7805 Rationale: The LM7805 is an easy-to-use and dependable voltage regulator that works well with the Curiosity Nano board. It gives a stable 5V output and only needs a couple of capacitors to set up. It\u2019s inexpensive, widely available, and provides reliable power for the sensor and other parts of the circuit, making it a practical choice for this project.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
