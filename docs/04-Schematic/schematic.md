## Overview

This schematic is primarily designed to support the Trash Height Subsystem of the AutoCan. This subsystem uses an IR sensor to detect when the trash has reached a critical height and sends a signal to the External IR Sensor and UI Lights subsystem. The signal triggers the front-facing LED to inform the user that the trash is full and needs to be emptied.
