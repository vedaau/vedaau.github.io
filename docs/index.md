## Introduction

* **This needs to be updated so that a reader gets an idea of the purpose of this datasheet.**

### Project Summary

* This needs to be updated to reflect <ins>your version</ins> of the team project, so when shared not via the team's report, the reader gets an idea of the direction of the project and how your work will contribute to the overall success.
* Add context that ties into the link to your [team report.](https://egr314-s-2026-303.github.io/)

### My Contribution


My part in the Sable project was to design the Audio Subsystem. To do this, I researched and designed parts that would work together to...
The following are the major steps I have taken in designing my subsystem:  

- To view my Block Diagram, click [here](https://vedaau.github.io/02-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/). This part of the design process shows the general idea of how my PCB will function and how it uses a motor and H-Bridge to open and close the lid and communicates with the External IR Sensor and UI Lights subsystem. 
- To view my Component Selection, click [here](https://vedaau.github.io/03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/). This part of the design process displays the major components needed to build my subsystem including the motor and supporting circuitry as well as the parts I reviewed to choose the best fit for my design.
- To review details about materials used in my part of the project, click [here](https://vedaau.github.io/06-BOM/BOM/). 
- To view my Schematic, click [here](https://vedaau.github.io/07-Schematic/schematic/). This part of the design process shows the schematic for my subsystem, created using KiCad 9.0. 
- To view my Power Budget, click [here](https://vedaau.github.io/05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/). This part of the design process shows the expected power consumption of all components in my subsystem, used to select the correct fuse for the power supply.
