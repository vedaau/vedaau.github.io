## Introduction

This datasheet shows the design and development for the Trash Height Subsystem for Team 202's AutoCan: Automatic Trash Can Project.  
This subsystem uses an IR sensor to detect the fill level of the trash can and sends a signal to the External IR sensor and UI Lights subsystem.  
The signal triggers the appropriate indicators and notifys the user when the trash can is approaching capacity.
### Project Summary

For our (Team 202's) project, we designed an automatic trash can that improves on the shortcomings of existing trash cans. The Trash Height Subsystem uses an internal IR sensor to monitor the fill level of the trash can. When the trash reaches a certain height, the subsystem sends a signal to the External IR Sensor and UI Lights subsystem. This triggers a red LED to notify the user that the trash is full and needs to be emptied, ensuring safe and convenient operation while helping maintain a clean environment.
