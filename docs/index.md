## Introduction

This datasheet shows the design and development for the Trash Height Subsystem for Team 202's AutoCan: Automatic Trash Can Project.  
This subsystem uses an IR sensor to detect the fill level of the trash can and sends a signal to the External IR sensor and UI Lights subsystem.  
The signal triggers the appropriate indicators and notifys the user when the trash can is approaching capacity.
### Project Summary

For our (Team 202's) project, we designed an automatic trash can that improves on the shortcomings of existing trash cans. The Trash Height Subsystem uses an internal IR sensor to monitor the fill level of the trash can. When the trash reaches a certain height, the subsystem sends a signal to the External IR Sensor and UI Lights subsystem. This triggers a red LED to notify the user that the trash is full and needs to be emptied, ensuring safe and convenient operation while helping maintain a clean environment.

### My Contribution

My part in the Autocan project was to design the Trash Height Subsystem. To do this, I researched and designed parts that would work together to measure the trash fill level and communicate when it reaches capacity. The following are the major steps I have taken in designing my subsystem:  

- To view my Block Diagram, click [here](https://vedaau.github.io/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/). This part of the design process shows the general idea of how my PCB will function and how it connects to the IR sensor to detect trash height and send signals to the External IR Sensor and UI Lights subsystem. 
- To view my Component Selection, click [here](https://vedaau.github.io/02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/). This part of the design process displays the major components needed to build my subsystem including the IR sensor and supporting circuitry as well as the parts I reviewed to choose the best fit for my design.

- To view my Schematic, click [here](https://vedaau.github.io/04-Schematic/schematic/). This part of the design process shows the schematic for my subsystem, created using KiCad 9.0. 
- To view my Power Budget, click [here](https://vedaau.github.io/05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/). This part of the design process shows the expected power consumption of all components in my subsystem, used to select the correct fuse for the power supply.
