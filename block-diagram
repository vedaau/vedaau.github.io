# Block Diagram – Fill Level Subsystem (Smart Trash Can)

This page presents the individual block diagram for my subsystem in the Smart Trash Can project.  
The fill-level subsystem detects the height of trash using a **VL53L1X Time-of-Flight Distance Sensor** connected to the **Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano**.
